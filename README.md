MySQL Database Schema design using InnoDB storage engine. It has foreign keys linking the users and other tables.

* **users**: The `users` table keeps the data of all users (borrowers and lenders)
* **ledger**: The `ledger` is the book keeping system that keeps track of all the debits and credits of each user so it has to be linked to the `users table`
* **loan_options**: The `loan_options` is the table collating loans created by lenders, so it has to be linked to the `users` table for each lender
* **loans**: The `loans` table collates data of loans that have been accepted by borrowers
* **transactions**: The `transactions` table collates data of all types of transactions for every user
